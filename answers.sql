ON Clauses:
p.patient_id = v.patient_id: Links patients to their visits.

Selected Columns: The query retrieves the patient_id, first_name, and last_name from the patients table, along with the provider_specialty from the providers table.*/

/* CONCAT(pr.first_name, ' ', pr.last_name): Combines the first and last names of the provider into a single column called provider_name.
COUNT(v.visit_id): Counts the number of visits associated with each provider. If a provider has no visits, the count will be 0 due to the LEFT JOIN.
LEFT JOIN: This ensures that all providers are listed, even those who have not had any visits.
GROUP BY provider_name: Groups the results by the providerâ€™s name to calculate the count of visits for each provider.*/

/*Join Logic: This query joins the patients, visits, and admissions tables as before.
Admission Condition: The WHERE clause checks that there is an admission_date present, implying that the visit resulted in an admission.
Columns Selected: The query selects patient_id, first_name, last_name, and admission_date.*/

/* explanation of the SQL query:

Select Columns:

The query starts by specifying the columns to retrieve from the database.
It selects the patient's first name, last name, and date of birth.
It combines the provider's first and last names into a single field called "provider name."
It also retrieves the date of the visit, blood pressure readings (both systolic and diastolic), the status of the visit, and the admission date.
From Clause:

The query uses the "patients" table as the primary source of data and gives it an alias (short name) for easier reference.
Joins:

The query connects to the "visits" table based on matching patient IDs. This means it will only pull visits that are linked to patients in the database.
It then joins the "providers" table to get information about the healthcare providers who attended to the patients during their visits.
Finally, it connects to the "admissions" table to get details about the admissions related to those visits.
Filtering Results:

The query includes a condition that ensures only visits with a valid admission date are included in the results. This means it filters out any visits that did not result in an admission.
Ordering the Results:

The results are sorted so that the most recent visits appear first, based on the visit date.
Overall, this query gathers detailed information about patients, their visits, the providers involved, and any related admissions, while ensuring the data is relevant and up-to-date.*/
